ceil2ff

A python package for converting any *known* ceilometer raw data formats into SI
(m^-1 sr^-1) backscatter coefficient variables in a gridded flat file, 
with Unix timestamps. These files should be much easier to read by subsequent
processors. No averaging is to be computed.


This is an expansion off the basic code derived from initial development of the 
UUAdip data manager by Joe Young at the University of Utah.
